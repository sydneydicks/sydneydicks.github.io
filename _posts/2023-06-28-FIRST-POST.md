This is my first post. I'll detail my day in little chunks and we'll see if when I read this back, if I feel like I spend my time "well".

6:20am ??
I think I woke up around this time? I must've if I made a latte, watered the plants, ate breakfast, and worked a tad
all before a 7:30 meeting. Yea that's right!!!! Early birds be gettin those wurms.

9:20am
Headed to get my ears VACUUMED. The doc was so kind and I feel like a new person being able to hear out of both my ears again. 
Honestly was a little disorienting. Used my HSA card to cover the cost.
**$95.66**

10:30am
Back online after appt and a smoothie :)

12:30pm
N heats up leftovers for me while I keep trucking through meetings. Lots of random things to do and no appropriate amount of time
for me to do it. Excuse??

2:00pm
Last meeting of the day has me soooo drained. I cannot be a passive participant in meetings for 5 hours. 

3:00pm
At this point I decide I deserve a break and veg the f out on a Vampire Diaries binge. I may or may not sneak in my last hour of work
during this time.

6:45pm
Head to my tennis match! Haven't won in this league yet, but really just out there to play and ..socialize..

8:40pm
Lost our match and 'twas ugly but accomplished moving my body and having a fun time!! Feeling better about my mental space these days
and playing tennis. Focusing on the all the little details and tweaks to be made has been very engaging for me recently. 

9:00pm
Back home and N made a delightful lil salad. Chow that down with a Topo Chico and then hit the showers. Write a few thank-you cards
and start to work on this blog. So far, I've been able to figure out maybe 1 error without help from N, but that is a win for me!! Also 
this post is a huge win. This is progress! My totals for the day will be extremely light, but that's where the money isssss

Total for the day: **$95.66**
