This is my second post! We're back baby! Maybe. I was reminded of this while reading another Money Diaries today, a day I felt particularly like a can of SPAM in the pantry when you have some fine honey baked ham in the fridge that needs eatin (thank you N for the wonderful analogy). Let's see what I remembered about today shall we.

7:09am 
For some reason I keep snoozing exactly 9 minutes after my alarm goes off, does the snooze on my alarm just snooze for 9 minutes?? dragged my sorry lil pigs out of bed after those kind of dreams where you aren't being physically threatened, but mildy emotionally the whole time? felt like I dreamt the whole night - go REM! 

made some americanos and heated up the last piece of banana bread (RIP) to share with N. in this way, we started our morning with bliss.

8:10am ish
started "work"!

10:00am
got out of a disorienting 1:1 with my "mentor". why am I here?
made a smoothie to lift my spirits
S (friend (welcome to the blog!)) sent the link to register as a spectator for her climbing comp this weekend - signed N and up. so excited to watch! shes an #inspiration
~$10.00

2:00pm
found my way through the fog and to a bowl of ramen to warm my soul

4:00pm
long but most interesting meeting of the day complete. N gets home which triggers mild zoomies - we need to move our bodies - to the climbing gym!

5:30pm
home, shower, zoomies with Mimi (cat can be exposed to internet), started watching one of my lectures for the week (hypothesis testing letsss goooo)

6:20pmish??
eat some slappin burgers and broccoli #fartinglaterforsure. resume lecture with a chocolate chip cookie to sustain me.

8:00pm
finish lecture. feeling motivated so yea I look through the suggested textbook readings and download the latest homework. i even log into kaggle to see what competitions are going on. yea I can do this! read the title of a model having "extraordinary results in the NLP space" and my motivation takes a HIT. 

9:00pm
so here I am! probs will spend the next 20 mins figuring out how to get this uploaded to my repo. i just spend another 5 mins downloading a cat game on the ipad for Mimi that idk if she's vibing with it. ok word.

Very low spend day, but it was a day nonetheless. Definitely was on the up and up as it went on. let's see what tomorrow brings.

Total for the day: **$10.00**
